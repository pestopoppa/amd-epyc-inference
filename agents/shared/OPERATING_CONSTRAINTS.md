# Operating Constraints

## Filesystem and Storage

- Use `/mnt/raid0/` for project writes and caches.
- Do not create large artifacts in `/tmp`, `/var`, `~/.cache`, or home paths.
- Verify cache and temp paths before long runs.

Recommended environment variables:

- `HF_HOME=/mnt/raid0/llm/cache/huggingface`
- `PIP_CACHE_DIR=/mnt/raid0/llm/cache/pip`
- `TMPDIR=/mnt/raid0/llm/tmp`

## Test Safety

- Never use `pytest -n auto` on this machine.
- Use bounded worker counts (for example `-n 4` or default project settings).
- Prefer targeted test execution during iteration.

## Logging and Traceability

- Source `scripts/utils/agent_log.sh` for operational tasks.
- Record task start, key decisions, and task end.
- For system changes, log rollback commands before execution.

## Retry Policy

- Maximum 3 retries for the same failing command.
- After 3 failures, stop retrying and perform root-cause analysis.

## Dangerous Operations

Require explicit user confirmation and rollback planning before:

- Recursive deletes in data or model directories
- Kernel or boot-level configuration changes
- System-wide privileged changes that impact stability
